# Tinder-but-for-Projects

MVP (Minimum Viable Product, the backbone features it has to have)
1.Free app on Chinese android stores and Apple Store.
2.All the key Tinder interaction functions like swiping, chatting, profiles.
3. AI chatbot as well as matchmaking system.
4.A company website.


Additional Features to be added later
Category player pools (when enough users)
Web3 technology like NFT and IPFS for crowd-funding projects and smart contracts between collaborators. (Need to learn more)


Funding Sources
1.Begging from parents (lol)
2.Startup Contests Prizes
3.Personal income (If you have)
4.Ideally we won’t need investors if we can grow the user base organically.

Product Advantage
1.AI dramatically improves accessibility to build projects with vibe coding, meaning there will be a bullish trend in more people building projects.
2.AI and Web3 are part of the future, we integrate those technologies, riding the trend.
3.Positive social effect overall. This solves real life problems where people who like to build projects have no partners to build within an surrounded environment like universities. Currently don’t have a good platform to incentivize people to build together and talk about their ideas.
4. Have advantage over competitors:
a.TAIKAI (Website. Good use of Web3, but they’re not app, and only for hackathon, can mimic their technology)
b.OnlyFounders(App. Very similar to what we want to do but expensive and only for startup partners. We gonna make it free and better user experience)
c.CollabFinder (Website. Open sourced. But not well maintained)
d.Ziga (App. Old and business-focused app)
e.CoFoundersLab; Shapr; and many similar ones (Websites. Business-focused and service commission-based)


Target audience
Position: Just a chill, unserious social app about any kinds of projects. Focus on transferable skills rather than specific expertise.
1.People looking for project ideas out of mere curiosity, to find inspirations or be motivated by the community.
2.Investors looking to see interesting projects worthy of expanding.
3.People looking for partners for their projects
4.People who want to showcase their projects to the community and build connections.

Tech Stack
Communication: Google Chat, Github
Frontend: React Native
Backend: PostgreSQL, Tencent Vector Data Base
Server: Tencent Cloud

Monetization Plan
All the MVP features will be free as we try to handle the maintenance fee by ourselves at first.
The user base is the most valuable asset.
Endgame plan (we’re not charity after all):
Ads (Not like pop up ads, but allow premium users to have ways to make them show up more often. Or give premium labels like blue checkmarks to show they really care about this platform.)
Donation Box, begging for money.
Paid features that may be added afterwards.
Sell to big companies as a service tool for their platform.

Our shared vision
1.Gain programming knowledge and experiences like handling databases, UIs, Networking, collaborations. Via self-learning boosted by team motivations and shared knowledge.
2.Something to put in the repository.
3. An opportunity to change the Chinese university experience for students. Make people understand that doing projects is one of the most fun and effective way to learn something.
4. Giving a platform to the lonely builders to have more courage, motivation, and satisfaction by connecting with partners or showcasing their work.

Hosting server: ~100¥/month
Performance tracking service: currently not considered, but very expensive.
LLMs:~20$/month
Launch on Apple Store: 99$/year; Google Play: 25$ one-time; Other Chinese Android stores: not sure

Marketing Strategy Plans
1.We will attack Chinese markets as our main focus. About 1 week before the MVP is finished, we start our social media for all Chinese and foreign networks. Hire a CMO (ideally Chinese with startup spirit. If cannot find then Cody and Rhys would be in charge of CMO’s job temporarily while William can be the camera man cuz he doesn’t speak Chinese)
2.Make pre-launch promotion to find app-testers to be the first registered profiles to test out bugs and advise. Users will be found from our friends network and early social media followers.
3.Content Creation:
	a.Vlog about documenting our development experiences, lessons, thoughts, attending contests, going to other universities as well as school clubs.
	b.Podcast with founders to talk about various industries and drag it into the theme of projects.
	c.Demo videos. Our explanation of the building process and our philosophy.
4. What else?
