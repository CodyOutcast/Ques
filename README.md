# Ques 快索



Ques is an AI-powered matchmaking and networking platform for university students, alumni, and faculty that connects you with the person you’re looking for. When you chat with Ques, the agent finds users with genuine two-way potential and shows you their profile cards. If someone catches your interest, you can privately share your WeChat ID, allowing them to view your profile and decide whether to connect. Ques works for both professional networking and casual friendships, with a chat bot interface and swipeable profile cards designed for meaningful connections based on mutual benefit.
