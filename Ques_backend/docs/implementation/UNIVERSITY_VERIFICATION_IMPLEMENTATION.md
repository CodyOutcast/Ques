# University Verification System Implementation

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The university verification system has been successfully implemented with comprehensive .edu.cn domain validation and email confirmation workflow.

## 🗂️ Files Created/Modified

### New Files
- `models/university_verification.py` - Database model for university verifications
- `services/university_verification_service.py` - Complete service layer with validation and email workflow
- `routers/university_verification.py` - API endpoints for verification process
- `create_university_verifications_table.py` - Database table creation script

### Modified Files
- `main.py` - Added university verification router import and routing
- `models/users.py` - Added university_verification relationship

## 📊 Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE university_verifications (
    id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
    user_id BIGINT NOT NULL REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
    email VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    university_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    domain VARCHAR(100),
    verification_token VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
    verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    expires_at TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    verified_at TIMESTAMP,
    attempts INTEGER DEFAULT 0
);
```

## 🔧 API Endpoints

| Method | Endpoint | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| POST | `/api/v1/university/verify` | Start university email verification |
| POST | `/api/v1/university/confirm` | Confirm verification with token |
| GET | `/api/v1/university/status/{user_id}` | Check verification status |
| POST | `/api/v1/university/resend` | Resend verification email |

## 📧 Email Validation Features

### Supported Domains
- `.edu.cn` - Chinese university domains (primary)
- `.ac.cn` - Chinese academic institution domains  

### University Recognition
- **Peking University** - pku.edu.cn
- **Tsinghua University** - tsinghua.edu.cn  
- **Fudan University** - fudan.edu.cn
- **Shanghai Jiao Tong University** - sjtu.edu.cn
- **And 100+ more Chinese universities**

### Validation Rules
- ✅ Must be valid email format
- ✅ Must end with .edu.cn or .ac.cn
- ✅ Domain must be from recognized Chinese university
- ✅ Maximum 3 verification attempts per user
- ✅ Verification tokens expire in 24 hours

## 🔄 Verification Workflow

1. **User submits university email** → System validates domain
2. **Generate secure token** → Creates verification record in database  
3. **Send confirmation email** → Email with verification link sent to university address
4. **User clicks link** → Token validated and user marked as verified
5. **Update user profile** → University information added to user profile

## 🧪 Testing Results

All validation tests passed successfully:
- ✅ Email format validation working
- ✅ .edu.cn domain recognition working  
- ✅ Invalid email rejection working
- ✅ University info extraction working
- ✅ Database operations working

## 📱 Integration Status

The university verification system is now fully integrated into the main application:
- 🔗 Router included in `main.py`
- 🗃️ Database table created and indexed
- 📧 Email service integration ready
- 🔐 Authentication dependencies configured

## 🚀 Ready for Production

The system is production-ready with:
- Comprehensive error handling
- Security token generation
- Rate limiting (3 attempts max)
- Database transaction safety
- Proper logging throughout

## 📋 Next Steps

The university verification system is complete. Users can now:
1. Submit their .edu.cn email addresses
2. Receive verification emails
3. Confirm their university affiliation  
4. Gain verified university status in their profiles

This addresses the API documentation requirement for university verification with .edu.cn domain validation and email confirmation.
