Generic single-database configuration.

For testing, follow the below instructions
Step1 Run the Revision Command:
In terminal (repo root): alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Initial schema"
What This Does:
--autogenerate: Alembic scans your models (e.g., User) and the current DB, then auto-creates a migration script for differences (e.g., if "users" table doesn't exist, it will add a "create table" script).
-m "Initial schema": A message to describe this version (like a commit message).
Expected Output: Creates a file in /migrations/versions/ like xxxxxxx_initial_schema.py. It will have functions upgrade() (to apply changes) and downgrade() (to revert).
Review the Migration File:
Open the new file in /migrations/versions/.
It should have something like:
python

Collapse

Wrap

Run

Copy
def upgrade():
    op.create_table('users',
        sa.Column('id', sa.Integer(), nullable=False),
        # ... other columns ...
    )
If it's empty, that means your DB already matches the model (e.g., "users" table exists). That's fine for now.
Step 2: Apply the Migration
Run the Upgrade Command:
In terminal: alembic upgrade head
What This Does: Applies the latest migration ("head" means the newest one). It will create the "users" table if it doesn't exist.
Expected Output: "Running upgrade -> xxxxxxx, Initial schema" and "done".
If Error: If connection fails, check your .env vars or DATABASE_URL.
