# Intelligent Agent API Documentation

## Overview

The Intelligent Agent API provides AI-powered interactions with **3 distinct paths**:

1. **üîç Search** - Find matching users based on natural language criteria
2. **üí¨ Inquiry** - Answer questions about specific user profiles  
3. **üó®Ô∏è Chat** - General conversation and guidance

The system automatically detects user intent using GLM-4 LLM and routes to the appropriate handler.

## Endpoints

### 1. **POST `/conversation`** - Main Entry Point (Recommended)

Unified endpoint that automatically detects intent and routes to the appropriate handler.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "user_input": "find me a student based in shenzhen who have interest in developing mobile apps",
  "referenced_ids": null,
  "viewed_user_ids": []
}
```

**Parameters:**

| Field | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| `user_input` | string | ‚úÖ Yes | User's natural language input |
| `referenced_ids` | array[string] | ‚ùå No | List of user IDs being referenced (for inquiry mode) |
| `viewed_user_ids` | array[string] | ‚ùå No | List of already viewed user IDs to exclude from search |

#### Response Examples

**Search Intent Response:**

```json
{
  "type": "search_results",
  "intent": "search",

---

### 2. **POST `/search`** - Direct Search (Bypass Intent Detection)

Use this when you know the user wants to search for people. Skips intent analysis.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "user_input": "find students in Beijing interested in blockchain",
  "viewed_user_ids": ["123", "456"]
}
```

#### Response

Same format as search intent response from `/conversation`.

---

### 3. **POST `/analyze-intent`** - Intent Analysis Only

Analyze user input to determine intent **without executing** the action. Useful for UI/UX.

#### Request Body

```json
{
  "user_input": "tell me about this person's background",
  "referenced_ids": ["123"]
}
```

#### Response

```json
{
  "intent": "inquiry",
  "confidence": 0.88,
  "reasoning": "User is asking for detailed information about a specific person, indicating inquiry intent",
  "clarification_needed": false,
  "uncertainty_reason": null
}
```

**Intent Types:**

| Intent | Description | Example Inputs |
|--------|-------------|----------------|
| `search` | User wants to find people | "find students in Shanghai", "looking for AI developers" |
| `inquiry` | User asks about specific profile(s) | "tell me about their experience", "what are their skills?" |
| `chat` | General conversation | "how does this work?", "what can you help me with?" |

---

### 4. **GET `/stats`** - Agent Statistics

Get performance metrics and usage statistics.

#### Response

```json
{
  "stats": {
    "search_count": 1234,
    "total_candidates_found": 56789,
    "avg_search_time": 1.234,
    "cache_hit_rate": 0.67
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

### 5. **GET `/health`** - Health Check (No Auth Required)

Check if the intelligent agent service is operational.

#### Response

```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "service": "intelligent_agent",
  "vector_db": "connected",
  "llm": "connected",
  "timestamp": "2025-10-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

---

## Intent Detection Logic

The system uses **GLM-4 LLM** to analyze user input and classify into 3 intents:

### Search Intent
**Triggers when:**
- User wants to find people matching criteria
- Contains search keywords: "find", "looking for", "search for", "discover"
- Describes desired characteristics: skills, location, interests, role

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "find me a student based in shenzhen who have interest in developing mobile apps"
- ‚úÖ "looking for AI engineers in Beijing"
- ‚úÖ "search for designers interested in UX"

### Inquiry Intent
**Triggers when:**
- User asks questions about specific referenced users
- Contains inquiry keywords: "tell me about", "what is their", "how experienced"
- `referenced_ids` parameter is provided

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "tell me more about their AI experience" (with referenced_ids)
- ‚úÖ "what are their main skills?" (with referenced_ids)
- ‚úÖ "how compatible are we?" (with referenced_ids)

### Chat Intent
**Triggers when:**
- General conversation or help request
- Unclear intent requiring clarification
- Questions about the platform itself

**Examples:**
- ‚úÖ "how does this platform work?"
- ‚úÖ "what can you help me with?"
- ‚úÖ "hello"

---

## Search Features

### Vector Search Technology
- **BGE-M3**: 1024-dimensional dense embeddings for semantic search
- **SPLADE** (optional): Sparse embeddings for keyword matching
- **Tencent VectorDB**: High-performance vector database with 150 users

### Search Strategies
1. **DBSF (Default)**: Dense + BM25 + Sparse Fusion
2. **RRF (Fallback)**: Reciprocal Rank Fusion for expanded results
3. **Custom**: Adaptive strategy based on query characteristics

### Result Limit
Returns **up to 50 candidates** per search, ranked by relevance.

  "status_code": 500
}
```

**Common Error Codes:**

| Code | Description |
|------|-------------|
| 401 | Unauthorized - Missing or invalid token |
| 500 | Internal Server Error - Service failure |

headers = {
    "Authorization": "Bearer <your_jwt_token>",
    "Content-Type": "application/json"
}

base_url = "http://localhost:8000/api/v1/intelligent"

# 1. Main conversation endpoint (recommended)
response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/conversation",
    json={
        "user_input": "find me a student based in shenzhen who have interest in developing mobile apps",

    },
    headers=headers
)
result = response.json()
print(f"Intent: {result['intent']}")
print(f"Results: {result['total_results']}")

# 2. Analyze intent first
intent_response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/analyze-intent",
    json={
        "user_input": "tell me about their experience"
    },
    headers=headers
)
intent = intent_response.json()
print(f"Detected intent: {intent['intent']} (confidence: {intent['confidence']})")

# 3. Direct search
search_response = requests.post(
    f"{base_url}/search",
    json={
        "user_input": "find AI engineers in Beijing",
        "viewed_user_ids": ["123", "456"]
    },

## FAQ

**Q: Which endpoint should I use?**  
A: Use **`POST /conversation`** - it automatically detects intent and routes appropriately.

**Q: How do I search for users?**  
A: Just send natural language like "find students in Shanghai interested in AI" to `/conversation`.

**Q: How do I ask about a specific user?**  
A: Send your question with `referenced_ids`: `{"user_input": "tell me about their skills", "referenced_ids": ["123"]}`.

**Q: Can I exclude certain users from search?**  
A: Yes, use `viewed_user_ids` to exclude already seen users.

**Q: How many search results do I get?**  
A: Up to **50 candidates** ranked by relevance.

**Q: What if the agent doesn't understand my input?**  
A: It will respond in chat mode asking for clarification.
