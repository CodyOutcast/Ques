# Agent Cards System Implementation Summary

## Overview
Implemented a new Agent Cards system that replaces the previous project slots concept. This system allows users to swipe on AI-generated project idea cards, with left swipes adding cards to history and right swipes creating likes.

## Key Features

### 1. Agent Cards Model (`models/agent_cards.py`)
- **AgentCard**: Main model storing AI-generated project ideas
  - Based on `agent_card.json` structure
  - Fields: title, scope, description, features, timeline, difficulty, skills, relevance score
  - Enums for difficulty levels and project scopes
  
- **AgentCardSwipe**: Tracks all user swipes (left/right)
- **AgentCardLike**: Stores liked cards (right swipes) with optional notes and interest level
- **AgentCardHistory**: Stores rejected cards (left swipes) with optional feedback
- **UserAgentCardPreferences**: User preferences for card recommendations

### 2. Service Layer (`services/agent_cards_service.py`)
- **AgentCardsService**: Core business logic
  - Create cards from JSON data
  - Generate personalized recommendations
  - Record swipes and manage likes/history
  - Statistics and analytics
  - User preference management

### 3. API Endpoints (`routers/agent_cards.py`)
- `GET /api/agent-cards/recommendations` - Get personalized card recommendations
- `POST /api/agent-cards/swipe` - Record swipe actions
- `GET /api/agent-cards/likes` - Get user's liked cards
- `GET /api/agent-cards/history` - Get user's swipe history
- `GET /api/agent-cards/statistics` - Get swipe statistics
- `GET/PUT /api/agent-cards/preferences` - Manage user preferences
- `POST /api/agent-cards/admin/create-cards` - Create cards from AI data
- `GET /api/agent-cards/card/{card_id}` - Get specific card details

### 4. Database Schema
New tables created:
- `agent_cards` - Store AI-generated project ideas
- `agent_card_swipes` - Track all user swipe actions
- `agent_card_likes` - Store liked cards with metadata
- `agent_card_history` - Store rejected cards with feedback
- `user_agent_card_preferences` - User recommendation preferences

### 5. Swipe Actions
- **Left Swipe** → Add to history (rejection)
  - Optional rejection reason and feedback
  - Card marked as "seen" to avoid future recommendations
  
- **Right Swipe** → Add to likes (interest)
  - Optional interest level (1-5 scale)
  - Optional notes about why user liked it
  - Card saved for future reference

### 6. Recommendation Engine
- Personalized recommendations based on user preferences
- Filters by difficulty level, project scope, skills
- Excludes previously swiped cards
- Relevance scoring and ranking
- Configurable daily limits

### 7. Sample Data Integration
- Based on `agent_card.json` structure
- Sample cards include:
  - AI-Powered Study Assistant
  - Community-Driven Recipe Platform
  - Smart Home Energy Monitor
- `load_sample_cards.py` script to populate database

### 8. Testing Infrastructure
- `test_agent_cards.py` - Comprehensive test client
- Tests all endpoints and user flows
- Sample data loading and manipulation
- Statistics and analytics verification

## API Usage Examples

### Get Recommendations
```bash
GET /api/agent-cards/recommendations?limit=10&exclude_swiped=true
```

### Swipe Right (Like)
```bash
POST /api/agent-cards/swipe
{
  "card_id": 123,
  "action": "right",
  "interest_level": 4,
  "notes": "Love this AI project idea!"
}
```

### Swipe Left (Reject)
```bash
POST /api/agent-cards/swipe
{
  "card_id": 124,
  "action": "left",
  "rejection_reason": "Too complex",
  "feedback": "Need simpler projects for now"
}
```

### Update Preferences
```bash
PUT /api/agent-cards/preferences
{
  "preferred_difficulty_levels": ["Intermediate", "Advanced"],
  "preferred_skills": ["Python", "React", "AI"],
  "min_relevance_score": 0.8
}
```

## Data Flow
1. **Card Creation**: AI generates project ideas → JSON format → Database
2. **Recommendations**: User requests → Filter by preferences → Return ranked cards
3. **Swiping**: User swipes → Record action → Create like/history record
4. **Analytics**: Track engagement → Generate statistics → Improve recommendations

## Benefits Over Previous System
- **Simpler User Experience**: Just swipe left/right instead of complex slot management
- **Better Data Collection**: Rich feedback and preference data
- **Scalable**: Easy to add more cards and recommendation logic
- **Analytics-Friendly**: Built-in statistics and tracking
- **AI-Ready**: Designed for AI-generated content integration

## Integration Points
- **Main App**: Added to `main.py` router configuration
- **User Model**: Added relationship to preferences
- **Database**: New tables with proper foreign key relationships
- **Authentication**: Uses existing auth system
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error responses and logging

## Next Steps
1. Create database migration for new tables
2. Test system with sample data
3. Integrate with AI agent for real-time card generation
4. Add advanced recommendation algorithms
5. Implement push notifications for new cards
6. Add card sharing and collaboration features

The Agent Cards system provides a modern, engaging way for users to discover and interact with AI-generated project ideas through a familiar swipe interface.
