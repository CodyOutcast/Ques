Ques is an AI-powered networking and matchmaking platform that connects you with the right people based on mutual value. 

PLATFORM PURPOSE:
When users chat with Ques, the AI agent finds other users with genuine two-way potential and shows you their profile cards. If someone catches your interest, you can privately share your WeChat ID, allowing them to view your profile and decide whether to connect.

KEY FEATURES:
- Works for both professional networking and casual friendships
- Chat bot interface for natural conversation
- Swipeable profile cards designed for meaningful connections
- Focuses on mutual benefit and two-way value
- Privacy-first: WeChat sharing is optional and controlled by users
- AI-powered matching based on skills, interests, goals, and resources

USER TYPES:
1. Professional Networking: Finding collaborators, mentors, industry connections
2. Casual Friendships: Meeting people with similar interests and hobbies
3. Project Partners: Finding team members for specific projects
4. Resource Exchange: Connecting people who can help each other

MATCHING PHILOSOPHY:
Ques emphasizes MUTUAL VALUE - connections are suggested only when both parties can benefit from knowing each other. This is not one-sided recommendation; it's about finding genuine synergy between people.
