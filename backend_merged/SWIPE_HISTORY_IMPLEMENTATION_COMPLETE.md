# Swipe History Database Integration - Implementation Summary

## 🎯 Objective Completed
✅ **Database contains user history of swiping other users for search filtering**

The database now has comprehensive swipe history tracking that integrates with the search system to filter out previously swiped users, ensuring users only see fresh, unseen profiles.

## 🗄️ Database Infrastructure

### UserSwipe Model (`models/likes.py`)
```python
class UserSwipe(Base):
    __tablename__ = "user_swipes"
    
    swipe_id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    swiper_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.user_id"), nullable=False)
    target_id = Column(Integer, ForeignKey("users.user_id"), nullable=False)
    direction = Column(SQLEnum(SwipeDirection), nullable=False)
    timestamp = Column(DateTime, default=datetime.utcnow)
    
    # Relationships
    swiper = relationship("User", foreign_keys=[swiper_id], back_populates="sent_swipes")
    target = relationship("User", foreign_keys=[target_id], back_populates="received_swipes")

class SwipeDirection(enum.Enum):
    like = "like"
    dislike = "dislike"
```

### User Model Relationships
```python
class User(Base):
    # ... other fields ...
    
    # Swipe relationships
    sent_swipes = relationship("UserSwipe", foreign_keys="UserSwipe.swiper_id", back_populates="swiper")
    received_swipes = relationship("UserSwipe", foreign_keys="UserSwipe.target_id", back_populates="target")
```

## 🔧 SwipeService Implementation

### Core Service (`services/swipe_service.py`)
```python
class SwipeService:
    @staticmethod
    def get_all_swiped_user_ids(db: Session, user_id: int) -> List[int]:
        """Get all user IDs that have been swiped on (for search filtering)"""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_liked_user_ids(db: Session, user_id: int) -> List[int]:
        """Get user IDs that have been liked"""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_disliked_user_ids(db: Session, user_id: int) -> List[int]:
        """Get user IDs that have been disliked"""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_mutual_likes(db: Session, user_id: int) -> List[int]:
        """Get user IDs with mutual likes"""
        
    @staticmethod
    def get_swipe_stats(db: Session, user_id: int) -> dict:
        """Get comprehensive swipe statistics"""
```

## 🔍 Search Integration

### Updated Search Workflow (`app.py`)
```python
def vector_search_workflow(search_prompt: str, user_id: int, db: Session = None) -> List[dict]:
    """Search with automatic swipe history filtering"""
    
    # 1. Get user's swipe history
    viewed_user_ids = SwipeService.get_all_swiped_user_ids(db, user_id)
    viewed_user_ids_str = [str(uid) for uid in viewed_user_ids]
    
    # 2. Use intelligent search with filtering
    search_results = await agent.intelligent_search(
        user_query=search_prompt,
        current_user=current_user_dict,
        viewed_user_ids=viewed_user_ids_str  # 🎯 Filtered automatically
    )
    
    # 3. Return only unseen users
    return filtered_results
```

### Intelligent Search Agent Integration
```python
# intelligent_search_agent.py - Already supports viewed_user_ids filtering
async def intelligent_search(
    self,
    user_query: str,
    current_user: dict = None,
    referenced_users: List[Dict] = None,
    viewed_user_ids: List[str] = None  # 🎯 Swipe history filtering
) -> Dict:
```

## 🛠️ API Endpoints

### Search with Automatic Filtering
```http
POST /ai/search
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "search_prompt": "Looking for Python developers",
    "session_type": "search"
}
```
**Response:** Only returns users that haven't been swiped on

### Swipe History Management
```http
GET /swipes/history
# Returns user's complete swipe history and statistics

GET /swipes/mutual-likes  
# Returns users with mutual likes

POST /swipes/check
# Check if user has swiped on specific target user
```

## 📊 How It Works

### 1. User Swipes on Profiles
```
User A swipes RIGHT (like) on User B    → UserSwipe(A→B, like)
User A swipes LEFT (dislike) on User C  → UserSwipe(A→C, dislike)
User A swipes RIGHT (like) on User D    → UserSwipe(A→D, like)
```

### 2. Search Automatically Filters
```
User A searches for "Python developers"

🔄 System automatically:
1. Queries: SwipeService.get_all_swiped_user_ids(db, user_A_id)
2. Returns: [B, C, D] (all previously swiped users)
3. Passes to search: viewed_user_ids=["B", "C", "D"]
4. Search excludes: Users B, C, D from results
5. Returns: Only fresh, unseen profiles
```

### 3. Search Results Are Always Fresh
```
✅ User sees: New profiles they haven't interacted with
❌ User won't see: Profiles they've already liked or disliked
🎯 Result: Better user experience, no duplicate interactions
```

## 🔬 Algorithm Integration

### Search Strategies with Filtering
1. **Standard Search** (50 users → filter → top 10)
   - Fetches 50 closest matches
   - Removes already swiped users
   - Returns top 10 filtered results

2. **Expanded Search** (150 users → filter → top 10)
   - Fetches 150 closest matches  
   - Removes already swiped users
   - Returns top 10 filtered results

3. **Custom Search** (fallback with filtering)
   - Custom search strategy
   - Still applies swipe history filtering

### Qdrant Vector Filtering
```python
# Filter applied at vector database level for efficiency
qdrant_filter = Filter(
    must_not=[
        FieldCondition(key="user_id", match=MatchValue(value=uid))
        for uid in viewed_user_ids
    ]
)
```

## 🔮 Usage Examples

### Creating Swipes
```python
# User swipes on profiles
swipe = UserSwipe(
    swiper_id=1,
    target_id=2, 
    direction=SwipeDirection.like,
    timestamp=datetime.utcnow()
)
db.add(swipe)
db.commit()
```

### Retrieving Swipe History
```python
# Get all swiped users for filtering
swiped_users = SwipeService.get_all_swiped_user_ids(db, user_id=1)
# Returns: [2, 3, 4, 5] (user IDs of swiped profiles)

# Get statistics
stats = SwipeService.get_swipe_stats(db, user_id=1)
# Returns: {total_swipes: 10, total_likes: 6, like_rate: 60.0, ...}
```

### Search with Filtering
```python
# Search automatically excludes swiped users
results = vector_search_workflow("Python developer", user_id=1, db=db)
# Returns: Only profiles user hasn't swiped on
```
